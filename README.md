#Project Documentation
##Skill Development & Employment Portal for Rural Youth on Salesforce

#Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis
##Project Title:
##Skill Development & Employment Portal for Rural Youth on Salesforce

Industry:
Education & Employment (Social Impact)

Project Type:
B2C & B2B Salesforce CRM Implementation

Target Users:
‚Ä¢	Rural Youth (job seekers & students)
‚Ä¢	Training Institutes / NGOs
‚Ä¢	Employers (Companies, SMEs)
‚Ä¢	Government Agencies

1.Problem Statement
 	Rural youth often lack access to skill development opportunities and structured pathways to employment.
 	Traditional methods (offline job fairs, manual tracking) are slow, fragmented, and ineffective in connecting skilled youth with potential employers.

The company/NGO wants to implement a Salesforce CRM system that:

‚Ä¢	Automates candidate registration and skill tracking
‚Ä¢	Enables employers to post jobs and shortlist candidates
‚Ä¢	Provides real-time dashboards for NGOs/Government monitoring
‚Ä¢	Sends alerts (SMS/Email) for interviews, jobs, and training updates

Proposed Solution:
A "Skill Development & Employment Portal for Rural Youth" built on Salesforce CRM that:

‚Ä¢	Connects rural youth with training programs and job opportunities.

‚Ä¢	Provides real-time tracking of skill progress, certifications, and placements.
‚Ä¢	Bridges the gap between training institutes, NGOs, industries, and job seekers.
‚Ä¢	Uses Salesforce automation, analytics, and AI features to optimize the process.

2. Requirement Gathering
‚Ä¢	Identify pain points of rural youth (lack of exposure, mentorship, placement channels).
‚Ä¢	Identify needs of industries (skilled candidates, verified certifications, easy onboarding).
‚Ä¢	Identify NGO/training providers' needs (student progress monitoring, fund reporting).
‚Ä¢	Requirements from government bodies (impact reports, placement data).

3. Stakeholder Analysis
Primary Stakeholders: Rural Youth (job seekers), Employers (industries, companies).
Secondary Stakeholders: NGOs, Training Institutes, Skill Development Agencies.
Tertiary Stakeholders: Government agencies, Placement officers, Salesforce admins.
Stakeholders =>

o	Rural Youth ‚Üí Candidates
o	Employers ‚Üí Job Providers
o	Training Institutes / NGOs ‚Üí Trainers & Program Managers
o	Government Agencies ‚Üí Regulators/Funders
o	System Admins & Developers ‚Üí Technical Setup

4. Business Process Mapping
Current Scenario (Without Salesforce):
‚Ä¢	Manual registration through physical forms.
‚Ä¢	Limited or no digital skill progress tracking.
‚Ä¢	Difficult placement coordination.
Proposed Future (With Salesforce):
‚Ä¢	Online registration of candidates through Salesforce Community portals.
‚Ä¢	Automated matching of skills with employer requirements.
‚Ä¢	Real-time dashboards for tracking training completion and job placements.
‚Ä¢	Automated email/SMS notifications for interviews, job fairs, and results.

Types of Relationships
1.	Lookup Relationship
‚Ä¢	Loose connection between objects.
‚Ä¢	Child record can exist without parent.
‚Ä¢	Example: A Skill record linked to a Student (but can exist even if no student is assigned).
2.	Master-Detail Relationship
‚Ä¢	Strong connection (parent-child).
‚Ä¢	Child record cannot exist without parent.
‚Ä¢	Parent controls child record‚Äôs lifecycle, ownership, and sharing.
‚Ä¢	Example: Enrollment (child) must belong to a Student (parent).
3.	Hierarchical Relationship
‚Ä¢	Only available on User object.
‚Ä¢	Used to link users to managers (self-relationship).
‚Ä¢	Example: User ‚Üí Manager reporting.
‚Ä¢	(Only possible on User object ‚Üí usually for reporting lines, e.g., Manager field).
‚Ä¢	Hierarchical is Not required for my current model,


Steps in Schema Builder
1. Create a Lookup Relationship
‚Ä¢	In Schema Builder ‚Üí drag Lookup Relationship from left panel.
‚Ä¢	Drop it into the child object box (e.g., Training).
 
‚Ä¢	Popup appears:
‚Ä¢	Related To: Trainer.
‚Ä¢	Field Label: "Trainer Name".
‚Ä¢	Save ‚Üí A line appears between Training and Trainer.

2. Create a Master-Detail Relationship
‚Ä¢	Drag Master-Detail Relationship ‚Üí Drop into Enrollment.
‚Ä¢	Popup appears:
‚Ä¢	Related To: Student.
‚Ä¢	Field Label: "Student Name".
‚Ä¢	Save ‚Üí Line shows Enrollment ‚Üí Student.
‚Ä¢	Repeat for Enrollment ‚Üí Training.
 

3. Arrange Schema
‚Ä¢	Drag object boxes on canvas so relationships are clearly visible:
‚Ä¢	Put Student and Training at top.
‚Ä¢	Place Enrollment in middle as junction.
‚Ä¢	Keep Trainer near Training.
‚Ä¢	Place Skill near Student.

9. Junction Objects

‚Ä¢	Used for many-to-many relationships.
‚Ä¢	Example:
‚Ä¢	JobSkill__c ‚Üí Junction between Job__c and Skill__c.
‚Ä¢	Allows a job to require multiple skills and one skill to belong to multiple jobs.
Job__c ‚Üî JobSkill__c ‚Üî Skill__c

‚Ä¢	A junction object is a custom object used to create a many-to-many relationship between two objects.
‚Ä¢	It achieves this by having two Master-Detail relationships, one for each parent.

Enrollment is the junction object.
‚Ä¢	Why?
‚Ä¢	A Student can enroll in many Trainings.
‚Ä¢	A Training can have many Students.
‚Ä¢	To handle this many-to-many relationship ‚Üí Enrollment is required.

 


Here Enrollment acts as a Junction Object

10. External Objects

Used to integrate data outside Salesforce (via OData).
Example:
‚Ä¢	External_Training__x ‚Üí Connects Salesforce to an external LMS (Learning Management System).
‚Ä¢	External_Translation__x ‚Üí Connects Salesforce to AI Translation API logs.

‚Ä¢	External Objects let Salesforce connect to data stored outside Salesforce (in external systems).
‚Ä¢	They are similar to custom objects but their records live in another system (not in Salesforce DB).
‚Ä¢	Accessed in Salesforce using Salesforce Connect.
‚Ä¢	Currently I‚Äôm not using it might use in upcoming phase if required

11. Documentation Deliverables
For Phase 3, include:
‚Ä¢	Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) ‚Üí Show Standard & Custom Objects + relationships.
‚Ä¢	Custom Object & Field Tables ‚Üí Name, API Name, Type, Description.
‚Ä¢	Record Type & Layout Mapping ‚Üí Which record types use which layouts.
‚Ä¢	Junction Object Mapping ‚Üí Many-to-many relationships.
‚Ä¢	Screenshots: Schema Builder, Page Layout, Compact Layout.
