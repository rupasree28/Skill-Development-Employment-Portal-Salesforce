#Project Documentation
##Skill Development & Employment Portal for Rural Youth on Salesforce

#Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis
##Project Title:
##Skill Development & Employment Portal for Rural Youth on Salesforce

Industry:
Education & Employment (Social Impact)

Project Type:
B2C & B2B Salesforce CRM Implementation

Target Users:
‚Ä¢	Rural Youth (job seekers & students)
‚Ä¢	Training Institutes / NGOs
‚Ä¢	Employers (Companies, SMEs)
‚Ä¢	Government Agencies

1.Problem Statement
 	Rural youth often lack access to skill development opportunities and structured pathways to employment.
 	Traditional methods (offline job fairs, manual tracking) are slow, fragmented, and ineffective in connecting skilled youth with potential employers.

The company/NGO wants to implement a Salesforce CRM system that:

‚Ä¢	Automates candidate registration and skill tracking
‚Ä¢	Enables employers to post jobs and shortlist candidates
‚Ä¢	Provides real-time dashboards for NGOs/Government monitoring
‚Ä¢	Sends alerts (SMS/Email) for interviews, jobs, and training updates

Proposed Solution:
A "Skill Development & Employment Portal for Rural Youth" built on Salesforce CRM that:

‚Ä¢	Connects rural youth with training programs and job opportunities.

‚Ä¢	Provides real-time tracking of skill progress, certifications, and placements.
‚Ä¢	Bridges the gap between training institutes, NGOs, industries, and job seekers.
‚Ä¢	Uses Salesforce automation, analytics, and AI features to optimize the process.

2. Requirement Gathering
‚Ä¢	Identify pain points of rural youth (lack of exposure, mentorship, placement channels).
‚Ä¢	Identify needs of industries (skilled candidates, verified certifications, easy onboarding).
‚Ä¢	Identify NGO/training providers' needs (student progress monitoring, fund reporting).
‚Ä¢	Requirements from government bodies (impact reports, placement data).

3. Stakeholder Analysis
Primary Stakeholders: Rural Youth (job seekers), Employers (industries, companies).
Secondary Stakeholders: NGOs, Training Institutes, Skill Development Agencies.
Tertiary Stakeholders: Government agencies, Placement officers, Salesforce admins.
Stakeholders =>

o	Rural Youth ‚Üí Candidates
o	Employers ‚Üí Job Providers
o	Training Institutes / NGOs ‚Üí Trainers & Program Managers
o	Government Agencies ‚Üí Regulators/Funders
o	System Admins & Developers ‚Üí Technical Setup

4. Business Process Mapping
Current Scenario (Without Salesforce):
‚Ä¢	Manual registration through physical forms.
‚Ä¢	Limited or no digital skill progress tracking.
‚Ä¢	Difficult placement coordination.
Proposed Future (With Salesforce):
‚Ä¢	Online registration of candidates through Salesforce Community portals.
‚Ä¢	Automated matching of skills with employer requirements.
‚Ä¢	Real-time dashboards for tracking training completion and job placements.
‚Ä¢	Automated email/SMS notifications for interviews, job fairs, and results.


5. Industry-specific Use Case Analysis

Types of Relationships
1.	Lookup Relationship
‚Ä¢	Loose connection between objects.
‚Ä¢	Child record can exist without parent.
‚Ä¢	Example: A Skill record linked to a Student (but can exist even if no student is assigned).
2.	Master-Detail Relationship
‚Ä¢	Strong connection (parent-child).
‚Ä¢	Child record cannot exist without parent.
‚Ä¢	Parent controls child record‚Äôs lifecycle, ownership, and sharing.
‚Ä¢	Example: Enrollment (child) must belong to a Student (parent).
3.	Hierarchical Relationship
‚Ä¢	Only available on User object.
‚Ä¢	Used to link users to managers (self-relationship).
‚Ä¢	Example: User ‚Üí Manager reporting.
‚Ä¢	(Only possible on User object ‚Üí usually for reporting lines, e.g., Manager field).
‚Ä¢	Hierarchical is Not required for my current model,


Steps in Schema Builder
1. Create a Lookup Relationship
‚Ä¢	In Schema Builder ‚Üí drag Lookup Relationship from left panel.
‚Ä¢	Drop it into the child object box (e.g., Training).
 
‚Ä¢	Popup appears:
‚Ä¢	Related To: Trainer.
‚Ä¢	Field Label: "Trainer Name".
‚Ä¢	Save ‚Üí A line appears between Training and Trainer.
 
________________________________________
2. Create a Master-Detail Relationship
‚Ä¢	Drag Master-Detail Relationship ‚Üí Drop into Enrollment.
‚Ä¢	Popup appears:
‚Ä¢	Related To: Student.
‚Ä¢	Field Label: "Student Name".
‚Ä¢	Save ‚Üí Line shows Enrollment ‚Üí Student.
‚Ä¢	Repeat for Enrollment ‚Üí Training.
 

3. Arrange Schema
‚Ä¢	Drag object boxes on canvas so relationships are clearly visible:
‚Ä¢	Put Student and Training at top.
‚Ä¢	Place Enrollment in middle as junction.
‚Ä¢	Keep Trainer near Training.
‚Ä¢	Place Skill near Student.

 
________________________________________
9. Junction Objects

‚Ä¢	Used for many-to-many relationships.
‚Ä¢	Example:
‚Ä¢	JobSkill__c ‚Üí Junction between Job__c and Skill__c.
‚Ä¢	Allows a job to require multiple skills and one skill to belong to multiple jobs.
Job__c ‚Üî JobSkill__c ‚Üî Skill__c

‚Ä¢	A junction object is a custom object used to create a many-to-many relationship between two objects.
‚Ä¢	It achieves this by having two Master-Detail relationships, one for each parent.

Enrollment is the junction object.
‚Ä¢	Why?
‚Ä¢	A Student can enroll in many Trainings.
‚Ä¢	A Training can have many Students.
‚Ä¢	To handle this many-to-many relationship ‚Üí Enrollment is required.

 


Here Enrollment acts as a Junction Object


________________________________________
10. External Objects

Used to integrate data outside Salesforce (via OData).
Example:
‚Ä¢	External_Training__x ‚Üí Connects Salesforce to an external LMS (Learning Management System).
‚Ä¢	External_Translation__x ‚Üí Connects Salesforce to AI Translation API logs.

‚Ä¢	External Objects let Salesforce connect to data stored outside Salesforce (in external systems).
‚Ä¢	They are similar to custom objects but their records live in another system (not in Salesforce DB).
‚Ä¢	Accessed in Salesforce using Salesforce Connect.
‚Ä¢	Currently I‚Äôm not using it might use in upcoming phase if required

________________________________________
11. Documentation Deliverables
For Phase 3, include:
‚Ä¢	Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) ‚Üí Show Standard & Custom Objects + relationships.
‚Ä¢	Custom Object & Field Tables ‚Üí Name, API Name, Type, Description.
‚Ä¢	Record Type & Layout Mapping ‚Üí Which record types use which layouts.
‚Ä¢	Junction Object Mapping ‚Üí Many-to-many relationships.
‚Ä¢	Screenshots: Schema Builder, Page Layout, Compact Layout.

ÔÅ∂	Enables automation (Flows, Triggers, Validation Rules) later.
ÔÅ∂	Supports reporting and dashboards.
ÔÅ∂	Prepares data model for scalability & integrations.


ÔÅ∂	Setup security, login policies, and sharing models.
ÔÅ∂	Prepared sandbox & deployment plan.


Phase 4: Process Automation (Admin)

Introduction
In this phase, we implemented automation features in Salesforce to streamline the workflow of our Skill Development & Employment Portal. The goal was to minimize manual tasks, improve accuracy, and ensure timely notifications for users (Students, Employers, Trainers, and Admins).
Salesforce provides multiple tools for process automation, and we applied them to enforce business rules, trigger actions, and guide the overall process.
________________________________________
Step 1 ‚Äî Preparing org and create test data (required before automation)
Purpose: enable email delivery & notifications and create sample records you‚Äôll use to test all automations (Job, Training, Student, Employer, Application).
in my Trailhead Playground (Lightning Experience):
1.	Launch  Playground / Dev Org
‚Ä¢	Go to Trailhead ‚Üí click your avatar ‚Üí Hands-on Orgs / Launch your Trailhead Playground (or open your Developer Edition org).
‚Ä¢	Confirm you're in the right org (org name shown in the top-right).
‚Ä¢	(Why): all configuration and screenshots must be done inside the org where you‚Äôll build automations.
2.	Open Setup
‚Ä¢	Click the Gear (‚öôÔ∏è) icon ‚Üí Setup.
3.	Enable Email Deliverability (so email alerts actually send)
‚Ä¢	In Setup Quick Find, type Deliverability ‚Üí open Deliverability.
‚Ä¢	Set Access Level (or Access to Send Email) to All Email ‚Üí Save.
 




‚Ä¢	Why: Email Alerts use your org‚Äôs deliverability setting ‚Äî Trailhead orgs default to 
‚ÄúSystem email only‚Äù which blocks test emails.


4.	Create 2 simple Lightning Email Templates (you‚Äôll wire these to Email Alerts later)
‚Ä¢	In Setup Quick Find, type Email Templates ‚Üí Email Templates.
‚Ä¢	Click New Email Template (Lightning). Create:
‚Ä¢	Template 1
‚Ä¢	Name: Job Application ‚Äì To Employer
‚Ä¢	Subject: New application for: {!Job__c.Name} (replace merge field with your Job field if different)
‚Ä¢	Body: short message: ‚ÄúA new candidate has applied. Applicant: {!Contact.Name}. Job: {!Job__c.Name}. View the application: {!Record.Link}‚Äù

 



‚Ä¢	Template 2
‚Ä¢	Name: Application Status ‚Äì To Student
‚Ä¢	Subject: Your application status for {!Job__c.Name}
‚Ä¢	Body: ‚ÄúHi {!Contact.FirstName}, your application status is now: {!Application__c.Status__c}.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	Save templates. (You don‚Äôt need perfect merge fields now ‚Äî placeholders are fine; we‚Äôll fix exact merge fields when wiring alerts.)
 



5.	Create Custom Notification Types (for in-app notifications)
‚Ä¢	In Setup Quick Find, type Notification Builder ‚Üí open Custom Notifications.
‚Ä¢	Click New and create two types:
‚Ä¢	New Application (API name New_Application) ‚Äî Channels: Desktop & Mobile (select available channels).
‚Ä¢	Application Status Changed (API name Application_Status_Changed) ‚Äî Channels: Desktop & Mobile.
‚Ä¢	Save.
 


6.	Create sample test records (so automations can be tested)
‚Ä¢	Use App Launcher (grid icon) ‚Üí search for your custom objects (e.g., Jobs, Trainings, Applications, Contacts).
‚Ä¢	Create:
‚Ä¢	Employer Account (Accounts) ‚Äî e.g., Acme Hiring
‚Ä¢	Contact / Student ‚Äî e.g., Rupa Sree (email a working email you control for testing)
‚Ä¢	Job Posting ‚Äî Title: Frontend Developer - Test, Location: Hyderabad, Salary Range: 20,000‚Äì40,000, Closing Date: (choose a future date)
‚Ä¢	Training Program ‚Äî Name: Full-Stack Bootcamp Test, Start Date: choose date
‚Ä¢	Job Application ‚Äî Link Applicant (Contact) to Job Posting, Status = Pending
‚Ä¢	Save each record.

Automation Components
 	Validation Rules
o	Purpose: Ensure data integrity by restricting incorrect or incomplete data entry.
o	Examples in Project:
o	Prevent students from registering without entering a valid email and phone number.
o	Ensure that job postings must include Salary Range and Job Location.
o	Block duplicate skill names in the Skills object.
o	Validation Rules ensure users enter correct data before saving records.
 	In our Skill Development & Employment Portal, we‚Äôll create rules like:
o	Students must enter a valid Email address
o	Job Posting must include Salary Range
________________________________________
üîπ Procedure (do this in my Trailhead Playground):
Rule 1: Candidate Email Validation

1.	Go to Setup ‚Üí Quick Find: Object Manager.
2.	Select your Candidate(Contact) object (if you‚Äôre using Contact for students).
3.	In the left panel, click Validation Rules ‚Üí New.
4.	Enter:
‚Ä¢	Rule Name: Valid_Email
‚Ä¢	Error Condition Formula:
‚Ä¢	NOT(REGEX( Email , "^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Za-z]{2,4}$"))
‚Ä¢	Error Message: Enter valid email
‚Ä¢	Error Location: Field ‚Üí Email.
5.	Save.
 
________________________________________
Rule 2: Job Posting Salary Range Required

1.	In Object Manager, open your Job  (custom object).
2.	Go to Validation Rules ‚Üí New.
3.	Enter:
‚Ä¢	Rule Name: Salary_Range_Required
‚Ä¢	Error Condition Formula:
‚Ä¢	ISBLANK( Salary_Range__c )
‚Ä¢	Error Message: Salary Range must be provided for all job postings.
‚Ä¢	Error Location: Field ‚Üí Salary Range.
4.	Save.
 

üîπ Testing the Rules
1.	Go to App Launcher ‚Üí open Students (Contacts).
‚Ä¢	Try creating a new student record with an invalid email (e.g., test@abc).
‚Ä¢	Confirm Salesforce blocks the save and shows your error message.

 

2.	Go to Job Postings ‚Üí create a new job posting without entering Salary Range.
‚Ä¢	Confirm Salesforce blocks save and shows your error message.
________________________________________
 	Workflow Rules
o	Purpose: Automate simple ‚Äúif-then‚Äù actions based on record changes.
o	Examples in Project:
o	When a Job Application is submitted, send an email alert to the employer.
o	If a training session is updated with a new schedule, notify registered students.
ÔÉò	Workflow Rules help you send alerts, update fields, or create tasks automatically when conditions are met.
ÔÉò	For our Skill Development & Employment Portal, let‚Äôs build one:
________________________________________
üîπ Use Case Example: Notify Employer when a Job Application is Submitted
When a student submits a new Job Application, the employer should immediately get an Email Alert.
Procedure
1.	Go to Setup ‚Üí Quick Find: Workflow Rules.
2.	Click New Rule.
3.	Select Object: Job (your custom object).
4.	Click Next.
5.	Enter:
‚Ä¢	Rule Name: Notify_Employer_New_Application
‚Ä¢	Evaluation Criteria: created (Evaluate the rule when a record is created).
‚Ä¢	Rule Criteria:
‚Ä¢	Field: Application Status
‚Ä¢	Operator: equals
‚Ä¢	Value: Pending
 


‚Ä¢	Click Save & Next.

 


________________________________________
1.	In Workflow Actions, click Add Workflow Action ‚Üí New Email Alert.

 
2.	Enter:
‚Ä¢	Description: New Job Application Alert to Employer
‚Ä¢	Email Template: Select Job Application ‚Äì To Employer (we created in Step 1).
‚Ä¢	Recipients: Add Employer Email (lookup field on Job Posting ‚Üí Employer ‚Üí Contact Email).
‚Ä¢	Save.

 
________________________________________
1.	Click Done.
2.	On Workflow Rules list ‚Üí select your new rule.
3.	Click Activate.

 
________________________________________
Testing the Workflow Rule
1.	Go to App Launcher ‚Üí Open Job Applications
 
2.	Create a new Job Application for a Student ‚Üí choose Job Posting ‚Üí set Status = Pending.
3.	Save.
 
4.	Check the Employer‚Äôs email inbox (or if testing with your email, check your inbox)

 

‚Ä¢	Workflow Rule detail page (showing criteria + email action).
‚Ä¢	Email received in inbox.
________________________________________
 	Process Builder
‚Ä¢	Purpose: Build more advanced automation with multiple conditions and actions.
‚Ä¢	Examples in Project:
‚Ä¢	Automatically assign a status = "Pending Review" when a new Job Application is submitted.
‚Ä¢	Create a Task for Admin when a new Training Program is added.
‚Ä¢	Send a Custom Notification to students when their application status changes.
Why Process Builder?
Workflow Rules are limited (one action at a time). Process Builder allows multiple conditions + multiple actions in a single automation.
For our Skill Development & Employment Portal, we‚Äôll build a process that:
1.	When a Job Application is created or updated,
‚Ä¢	Automatically set its Status = ‚ÄúPending Review‚Äù.
‚Ä¢	Create a Task for Admin to review the application.
‚Ä¢	Send a Custom Notification to the student.
________________________________________
üîπ Procedure

________________________________________
 	Approval Process
o	Purpose: Automate record approval workflows.
o	Examples in Project:
o	Employers‚Äô job postings go through an Admin approval process before being visible to students.
o	Training programs created by trainers require approval before publishing.
o	Why Approval Process?
It ensures that important records (like Job Postings or Training Programs) go through proper review before becoming active.
For our Skill Development & Employment Portal, let‚Äôs create one for Job Postings:
‚Ä¢	Employer submits a Job Posting.
‚Ä¢	Admin reviews & approves.
‚Ä¢	If approved ‚Üí Status = ‚ÄúApproved‚Äù.
‚Ä¢	If rejected ‚Üí Status = ‚ÄúRejected‚Äù.
‚Ä¢	Employer gets email notification.

 	Flow Builder
Salesforce Flows allowed us to create more advanced automations, including screens, record-triggered actions, and scheduled tasks.
‚Ä¢	Screen Flow: Guided student registration with conditional questions (e.g., education background).
‚Ä¢	Record-Triggered Flow: When a job is closed, automatically update related applications to "Not Selected".
‚Ä¢	Scheduled Flow: Send reminders to students about upcoming training sessions.
‚Ä¢	Auto-Launched Flow: Auto-assign default skills to new students upon registration.

Step 6: Flow Builder ‚Äî the most powerful automation tool in Salesforce.
We‚Äôll do this step-by-step with four types of Flows:
1.	Record-Triggered Flow ‚Üí auto actions when a record changes.
2.	Screen Flow ‚Üí guided wizard for users.
3.	Scheduled Flow ‚Üí runs on a schedule.
4.	Auto-launched Flow ‚Üí called by other automation (Process Builder, Apex).
________________________________________Use Case:

‚Ä¢	Email Template: Candidate Shortlist Notificat
‚Ä¢	ion
‚Ä¢	Recipient Type: Select Related User ‚Üí Candidate Email field
‚Ä¢	Save.
 
________________________________________
Step 3: Add Email Alert to Automation
You can attach this Email Alert to:
‚Ä¢	Workflow Rule (when Job Application Status = Shortlisted)
‚Ä¢	Process Builder (if we want more conditions, e.g., Skill Match ‚â• 80%)
‚Ä¢	Flow Builder (for advanced logic, e.g., send both Candidate & Recruiter emails).
Use Case
When a Job Application‚Äôs Status = Shortlisted, the candidate automatically receives the shortlist notification email.
________________________________________
üîπ Step-by-Step Procedure
Step 1: Go to Workflow Rules
1.	In Setup, search for Workflow Rules.
2.	Click New Rule.
________________________________________

________________________________________
Now, whenever a recruiter updates a candidate‚Äôs application to Shortlisted, the system will send an automated email üéâ


________________________________________
 	Field Updates
‚Ä¢	Automated field updates to reduce manual work:
‚Ä¢	Application Status auto-updates from "Pending" ‚Üí "Under Review" ‚Üí "Accepted/Rejected".
‚Ä¢	Job Posting status auto-updates to "Expired" after the closing date.

Objective
Field Updates allow us to automatically update a field‚Äôs value when certain conditions are met.
This reduces manual work and ensures data consistency.
________________________________________
üîπ Use Case in  Project
In the Skill Development Employment Portal, let‚Äôs implement:
‚Ä¢	When a Job Application Status = Selected, automatically update the Placement Status field on the Candidate record to Placed.
This way, admins and recruiters don‚Äôt need to manually mark a candidate as ‚ÄúPlaced.‚Äù

 	Tasks

‚Ä¢	Automated Task creation for Admins and Trainers:
‚Ä¢	Admin gets a task to review new Job Postings.
‚Ä¢	Trainer gets a task to prepare study materials when a new Training Session is created.

 Objective
Tasks allow Salesforce to automatically create to-do items for users (Recruiters, Admins, Trainers, etc.) when specific conditions are met.
This ensures no important step is missed.
________________________________________
üîπ Use Case in Project

‚Ä¢	Employer gets a notification when a new candidate applies.
 Objective
Custom Notifications allow Salesforce to send real-time alerts directly inside the Salesforce app (web or mobile), instead of only through email.
This keeps users (Recruiters, Admins, Trainers, Candidates) informed immediately.
