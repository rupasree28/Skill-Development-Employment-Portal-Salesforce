#Project Documentation
##Skill Development & Employment Portal for Rural Youth on Salesforce

#Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis
##Project Title:
##Skill Development & Employment Portal for Rural Youth on Salesforce

Industry:
Education & Employment (Social Impact)

Project Type:
B2C & B2B Salesforce CRM Implementation

Target Users:
‚Ä¢	Rural Youth (job seekers & students)
‚Ä¢	Training Institutes / NGOs
‚Ä¢	Employers (Companies, SMEs)
‚Ä¢	Government Agencies

1.Problem Statement
 	Rural youth often lack access to skill development opportunities and structured pathways to employment.
 	Traditional methods (offline job fairs, manual tracking) are slow, fragmented, and ineffective in connecting skilled youth with potential employers.

The company/NGO wants to implement a Salesforce CRM system that:

‚Ä¢	Automates candidate registration and skill tracking
‚Ä¢	Enables employers to post jobs and shortlist candidates
‚Ä¢	Provides real-time dashboards for NGOs/Government monitoring
‚Ä¢	Sends alerts (SMS/Email) for interviews, jobs, and training updates

Proposed Solution:
A "Skill Development & Employment Portal for Rural Youth" built on Salesforce CRM that:

‚Ä¢	Connects rural youth with training programs and job opportunities.

‚Ä¢	Provides real-time tracking of skill progress, certifications, and placements.
‚Ä¢	Bridges the gap between training institutes, NGOs, industries, and job seekers.
‚Ä¢	Uses Salesforce automation, analytics, and AI features to optimize the process.

2. Requirement Gathering
‚Ä¢	Identify pain points of rural youth (lack of exposure, mentorship, placement channels).
‚Ä¢	Identify needs of industries (skilled candidates, verified certifications, easy onboarding).
‚Ä¢	Identify NGO/training providers' needs (student progress monitoring, fund reporting).
‚Ä¢	Requirements from government bodies (impact reports, placement data).

3. Stakeholder Analysis
Primary Stakeholders: Rural Youth (job seekers), Employers (industries, companies).
Secondary Stakeholders: NGOs, Training Institutes, Skill Development Agencies.
Tertiary Stakeholders: Government agencies, Placement officers, Salesforce admins.
Stakeholders =>

o	Rural Youth ‚Üí Candidates
o	Employers ‚Üí Job Providers
o	Training Institutes / NGOs ‚Üí Trainers & Program Managers
o	Government Agencies ‚Üí Regulators/Funders
o	System Admins & Developers ‚Üí Technical Setup

4. Business Process Mapping
Current Scenario (Without Salesforce):
‚Ä¢	Manual registration through physical forms.
‚Ä¢	Limited or no digital skill progress tracking.
‚Ä¢	Difficult placement coordination.
Proposed Future (With Salesforce):
‚Ä¢	Online registration of candidates through Salesforce Community portals.
‚Ä¢	Automated matching of skills with employer requirements.
‚Ä¢	Real-time dashboards for tracking training completion and job placements.
‚Ä¢	Automated email/SMS notifications for interviews, job fairs, and results.


5. Industry-specific Use Case Analysis
ÔÉò	Lead Management ‚Äì Capture candidate details from portal/social media
ÔÉò	Skill Tracking ‚Äì Manage training courses and certifications
ÔÉò	Employer Job Posting ‚Äì Employers post job requirements
ÔÉò	Interview Scheduling ‚Äì Schedule & notify candidates
ÔÉò	Placement Tracking ‚Äì Update deal status once candidate is hired
ÔÉò	Reporting ‚Äì Dashboards for job placements, skill program success
6. AppExchange Exploration
Potential Salesforce AppExchange solutions to leverage:
ÔÇß	Learning Management Apps (LMS) ‚Üí To deliver training modules.
ÔÇß	Job Board / Recruitment Apps ‚Üí For candidate-employer matching.
ÔÇß	Survey Apps ‚Üí To collect feedback from candidates and employers.
