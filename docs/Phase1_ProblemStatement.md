# Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis

## Project Title
**Skill Development & Employment Portal for Rural Youth on Salesforce**

## Industry
Education & Employment (Social Impact)

## Project Type
B2C & B2B Salesforce CRM Implementation

## Target Users
- Rural Youth (job seekers & students)
- Training Institutes / NGOs
- Employers (Companies, SMEs)
- Government Agencies

##  1.Problem Statement
Rural youth often lack access to skill development opportunities and structured pathways to employment. Traditional methods (offline job fairs, manual tracking) are slow, fragmented, and ineffective in connecting skilled youth with potential employers.

The company/NGO wants to implement a Salesforce CRM system that:
- Automates candidate registration and skill tracking
- Enables employers to post jobs and shortlist candidates
- Provides real-time dashboards for NGOs/Government monitoring
- Sends alerts (SMS/Email) for interviews, jobs, and training updates

  **Proposed Solution:**  
A "Skill Development & Employment Portal for Rural Youth" built on Salesforce CRM that:  
- Connects rural youth with training programs and job opportunities.  
- Provides real-time tracking of skill progress, certifications, and placements.  
- Bridges the gap between training institutes, NGOs, industries, and job seekers.  
- Uses Salesforce automation, analytics, and AI features to optimize the process.

## 2. Requirement Gathering
- Identify pain points of rural youth (lack of exposure, mentorship, placement channels).  
- Identify needs of industries (skilled candidates, verified certifications, easy onboarding).  
- Identify NGO/training providers' needs (student progress monitoring, fund reporting).  
- Requirements from government bodies (impact reports, placement data).

## 3. Stakeholder Analysis
- **Primary Stakeholders:** Rural Youth (job seekers), Employers (industries, companies).  
- **Secondary Stakeholders:** NGOs, Training Institutes, Skill Development Agencies.  
- **Tertiary Stakeholders:** Government agencies, Placement officers, Salesforce admins.

  
Stakeholders

## 4. Business Process Mapping
**Current Scenario (Without Salesforce):**  
- Manual registration through physical forms.  
- Limited or no digital skill progress tracking.  
- Difficult placement coordination.  

**Proposed Future (With Salesforce):**  
- Online registration of candidates through Salesforce Community portals.  
- Automated matching of skills with employer requirements.  
- Real-time dashboards for tracking training completion and job placements.  
- Automated email/SMS notifications for interviews, job fairs, and results.

5. **Placement Tracking** – Update deal status once candidate is hired
6. **Reporting** – Dashboards for job placements, skill program success

## 6. AppExchange Exploration
Potential Salesforce AppExchange solutions to leverage:  
- **Learning Management Apps (LMS)** → To deliver training modules.  
- **Job Board / Recruitment Apps** → For candidate-employer matching.  
- **Survey Apps** → To collect feedback from candidates and employers.
